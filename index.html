            <!-- Parameter	               Units	Defined/Measured
Resting Potential (Vrest)	mV	The stable membrane potential after breaking the seal, with no current applied
Input Resistance (Rin)  	mΩ	Calculated from voltage responses to small negative current injections (typically 5-20 pA, XXX ms, from resting potential). Rin was then determined from Ohms law
Membrane time constant (τm)	ms	Calculated from voltage responses to small negative current injections (typically 5-20 pA, XXX ms, from resting potential). For τm, the voltage resposnes were fitted with a single expontial to the initial 100 ms of the response, omitting the first 1 ms. Determined from the monoexponential curve fitting the falling phase fo hte response to a small hyperpolarizing current step (XX-XX pa from resting poential)
Input Capacitance (Cin) 	pF	Cin was calculated as  τm/Rin.	
Rheobase                	pA	The minimal current need to elicit an AP, determined from -70mV (not corrected)
Threshold	                mV	The membrane potential atwhich the rate of rise exceeded 10 mV/ms for a single AP elicited with rheobase current
AP Amplitude	                mV	The difference between threshold and voltage at the peak of the AP
Spike Width	                ms	Measured at half height between threshold and peak action potential
Afterhyperpolarization (AHP)	mV	Difference between threshold and the most negative membrane potential after the spike, measured on the response to the smallest current step evoking an AP
AP Rate of Rise (ΔV/Δt) 	mV/ms	Maximal voltage slope (dmV/dms) during action potential upswing
AP Rate of Fall (ΔV/Δt)	        mV/ms	Maximal voltage slope (dmV/dms) during action potential downswing	
Adaptation Ratio (AR)	        -	The ratio of Fmax, steady state to Fmax, initial. Steady state defined as the last 5 APs. The current injection used for the measurement of adaptation and firing rate was the lowest current injection able to induce firing for the entire duration of the 1 s step (50-100 pA steps)
Frequency-current (F-I slope)	Hz/pA	Frequency– current slope, the slope of the regression line fitted to the initial, steeper portion of the F–I plot. Frequency was defined as the reciprocal of the first interspike interval (ISI)
First ISI(Fmax initial)	        Hz	The reciprocal of the first ISI, measured at the first current step applied to evoke sustained spiking (1 sec)
Change in AHP	                mV	Used IV, sweep that evoked 50 Hz first interval, then the amp of the first AHP and then compared to the last AHP (see beirlein 2003)

<Intrinsic Properties Analysis Method>
Electrophysiological Data Analysis. 
Intrinsic properties. Resting membrane potentials (RMP, in mV) were measured within 1 min of break-in,
with no current applied. Only cells with stable membrane potentials were included. Input resistances (Rin, in MΩ)
were determined using Ohms Law by measuring the voltage response, from rest, in response to small negative current
injections (5 - 20 pA; 500 ms duration; 7-99 sweeps; ~1.5 mV mean response). Membrane time constants (m, in ms)
were measured from the average voltage response (see input resistance above) by fitting a single exponential to the
initial falling phase of the response (100 ms; omitting the first 1 ms). For a few cells with particularly short time
constants, a shorter window was used to obtain a better fit. Input capacitance (Cin, in pF) was calculated as m / Rin.
Rheobase currents (in pA) were defined as the minimal positive current injection needed to evoke an AP from a
holding potential of -84 mV (1000 ms pulse duration; 5 pA steps). AP latencies (in ms) were determined by measuring
the time from the start of the rheobase current pulse to the peak of the first AP.AP thresholds (in mV) were determined
from the first AP evoked by the rheobase current and defined by the membrane potential at which the dV/dt of the AP
exceeded 10 mV/ms. AP amplitudes (in mV) were determined for the first AP evoked by the rheobase current and
measured as the difference between the threshold and the peak of the AP. AP half-widths (in ms) were determined for
the first AP evoked by the rheobase current and measured at the half height between threshold and the peak of the AP.
The max rate of rise (in mV/ms) was defined as the maximal dV/dt during the upswing of the first AP evoked by the
rheobase current. The max rate of decay (in mV/ms) was defined as the maximal negative dV/dt during the downswing
of the first AP evoked by the rheobase current. Afterhyperpolarizations (AHPs: in mV) were measured as the
difference between the threshold and the peak of the AHP. Spike frequency adaptation was determined by calculating
the adaptation ratio, defined as the firing frequency at the second or last interspike interval divided by the firing
frequency at the first interspike interval. For CT and CC cells, analysis was performed on a 1 s depolarizing current
step that generated sustained firing in which the initial firing rate was near 50 Hz. For interneurons, analysis was
performed on the smallest current step that generated sustained firing. The change in amplitude of AHPs (in mV) was
defined as the amplitude differences between the first and last AHP elicited by a 1 s depolarizing current step. Analysis
was performed on sweeps in which the firing frequency at the beginning of the train (first interspike interval) was near
50 Hz. Peak sag amplitudes (in mV) were measured in response to a 1 s negative current step (-200 pA for CT and
CC cells; -100 pA for interneurons) and calculated relative to the steady-state voltage at the end of the step (average
of last 200 ms). Analysis of electrophysiological data was performed using Molecular Devices Clampfit 10, AxoGraph
X, and Microsoft Excel.
